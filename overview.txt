"A short overview paper, providing information that is not readily available 
from reading the code, incomplete specifications, things that gave you trouble, 
etc. This paper should be plain ASCII text."

CS414 Design Assignment A1 Overview

-First, I constructed the class methods for Company, Project, Qualification, and Worker.java in order to lay out a barebone structure for the project's system.

-Soon after filling the java files with somewhat barebone un-tested skeleton methods, I created a git repository (https://github.com/jzman1/414A1.git) in order to have revision control for safe code development.

-After creating a functional git repository, I finished all of my barebone methods to have something to test

-After finishing barebone methods, I began testing using JUnit per class
	-found errors in Worker.java (toString method had null pointer exception found with JUnit testing)
	-found errors in Worker.java (willOverload method was not correctly counting overloads, caught and fixed using JUnit testing)
	-found errors in Project.java (missingQualifications)
	-found errors in Company.java (createProject was not properly adding project associations with their correlated company)
