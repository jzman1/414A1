CS414 Design Assignment A1 Overview

-First, I constructed the class methods for Company, Project, Qualification, and Worker.java in order to lay out a barebone structure for the project's system.

-Soon after filling the java files with somewhat barebone un-tested skeleton methods, I created a git repository (https://github.com/jzman1/414A1.git) in order to have revision control for safe code development.

-After creating a functional git repository, I finished all of my barebone methods to have something to test

-After finishing barebone methods, I began testing using JUnit per class
	-found errors in Worker.java (toString method had null pointer exception found with JUnit testing)
	-found errors in Worker.java (willOverload method was not correctly counting overloads, caught and fixed using JUnit testing)
	-found errors in Project.java (missingQualifications was not properly working due to set equality (needed to copy sets), caught and fixed using JUnit testing)
	-found errors in Company.java (createProject was not properly adding project associations with their correlated company)
	-found errors in Company.java (unassignAll was not properly working due to concurrency issues)
	-found errors in Company.java (finish was not working properly due to concurrency issues)

-After finishing the JUnit tests I completed TestAll.java, ensuring that all of the tests were executed from this one class.

-All of the print statements are commented out for clean testing

*** In order to maintain good and clean functionality for testing and smooth operation, I added a few class methods and Sets for this projects. A few examples of this are my Project.java addWorker, removeWorker and getProjectWorkers methods and projectWorkers/missingQualification global sets. I also added addProject, removeProject, global int workLoad and global set workerProjects to Projects.java in order for it to work seamlessly with the rest of the project code.
